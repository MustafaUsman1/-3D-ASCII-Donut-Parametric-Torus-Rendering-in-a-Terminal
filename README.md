# -3D-ASCII-Donut-Parametric-Torus-Rendering-in-a-Terminal
A real-time ASCII-rendered 3D torus built with pure Python and NumPy. Uses parametric torus geometry, depth buffering, and hand-crafted ASCII luminance to generate a hypnotic, spiraling donut directly in your terminal. Mathematically cursed. Aesthetically satisfying. Extremely unnecessary, yet beautiful.
